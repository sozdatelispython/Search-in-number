# OSearch

Hello, dear people, osearch is an osint tool for searching for any information

In the main menu we can see 4 items: Search by number, search by IP, search by passport and exit

The first item searches for information by number, it displays the country, mobile operator, and coordinates NOTE: COORDINATES POINT TO CITY CENTER

The second and third points are in development but I will try to do them as soon as possible

Well, I don’t think it’s worth explaining about the fourth point

Unfortunately, the program only supports Russian, but in the future I will try to add new languages
